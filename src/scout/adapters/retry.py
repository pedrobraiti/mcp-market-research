"""Shared HTTP retry/backoff for the keyless web adapters (GDELT, FRED, …).

The free data sources rate-limit (HTTP 429) and occasionally time out. A null field coming
from a rate-limit must NOT look like "this data does not exist" — that would mislead a
downstream data-sufficiency gate. So this helper retries transient failures (429 and connect/
read timeouts) with exponential backoff and, once exhausted, raises ``SourceUnavailable`` with a
machine-readable ``reason`` the adapter surfaces as a status (e.g. ``unavailable: rate_limited``)
instead of a silent ``None``.

Non-transient errors (a 404, a malformed payload, …) propagate immediately — they are genuine,
not worth retrying, and keep the existing error-envelope behaviour.

httpx is intentionally NOT imported here: failures are classified structurally (a ``response``
with ``status_code``) and by exception-class name, so offline tests can simulate a 429/timeout
with a tiny fake and never need the network.
