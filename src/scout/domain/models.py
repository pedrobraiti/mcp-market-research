"""Domain models — agnostic to the concrete data source.

Monetary and ratio values use ``Decimal`` to avoid floating-point noise (mirrors the
mcp-ibkr-agent convention). Every research model carries an optional ``as_of`` date: when
``None`` the data is the latest/real-time read; when set, it is (best-effort) the snapshot
as of that date. ``as_of`` is what lets the calling agent compose two stateless reads into
a "what changed since I bought?" diff — Scout never stores the date, it receives it.
