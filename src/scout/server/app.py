"""MCP server — exposes Scout's research capabilities as tools for the agent.

Every tool is a stateless read: it takes its inputs (including an optional ``as_of`` date),
reads the world, and returns a JSON-serializable ``{"ok": ..., "data": ...}`` envelope.
Errors become ``{"ok": false, "error": ...}`` so the agent reads them instead of breaking.
Scout never places orders and never persists state — that is by design (see CLAUDE.md).
